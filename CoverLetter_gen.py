letter = f"""Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my interest in the opportunity to define my master's thesis topic in line with the activities of your company, {company_name}, and the possibility of an internship while doing my master's.

I am currently pursuing my master's degree in data science and am only pending my thesis. I am confident that working with a well-established company like {company_name} would provide me with the necessary resources and knowledge to complete my thesis. I am particularly drawn to the company’s expertise in data analysis, which would allow me to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems and gain valuable experience in the field.

I am particularly interested in business data analytics, and I have a strong background in using Python and Tableau for data analysis, as well as database management using SQL. Additionally, I have experience in building and deploying predictive machine learning models using classical statistical methods, as well as neural networks, including deep learning approaches.

I have a background in engineering science and eight years of professional experience as a procurement specialist and project manager in different sectors, including the oil and gas industry. These experiences have prepared me well for the challenges and dynamic work environment I will likely face while working with {company_name}. I am confident in my ability to adapt to new situations, work in a fast-paced environment, and handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

I would be honored to contribute positively to the success of {company_name} and to have the opportunity to learn from your experienced data analysts. I understand the importance of data confidentiality and assure you that I would use the data only for the company’s needs and not disclose it outside the company under any circumstances unless advised otherwise.

At this time, financial gain is not my primary concern. I am primarily interested in gaining practical experience and hands-on experience in data analysis, and more importantly finishing my Master’s program productively. I believe that collaborating with {company_name}, or an internship would provide me with the ideal opportunity to gain this experience, and I would be grateful for the chance to work with such a well-respected company.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,
Marjan Aghelzadeh"""
